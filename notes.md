#Agile Software Development Using Ruby on Rails: Basics

##Software as a Service (Saas)
Like renting software
Benefits:
- No installation worries
- No worries about data loss
- Collaboration
- 1 copy of large / changing data sets
- Easier to develop

###Service-oriented architecture
Essential idea: Design software in a modular way

###Hardware for Saas
Needs:
- Communication
- Scalability
- Dependability

Solution: Clusters (Regular commodity computers connected by ethernet switches)
- More scalable
- Cheaper (20x!! due to economy of scale)
- Dependable by redundancy rather than individual machine quality

##Legacy code vs. beautiful code
People in industry say: Learn to deal with legacy code!

##Software quality
###Principles
1. Satisfy customer needs
2. Easy to develop

###Validation vs. verification
Verification means: Did you build the thing right?
Validation means: Did you build the right thing?

###Testing
####Levels of testing
- Unit tests
- Module or functional tests
- Integration tests: Tests interfaces between units
- Acceptance tests: Customer is satisfied

####Terminology
- Black box vs. white box testing
- Test coverage
- Regression testing
- Continuous integration (CI): Continuous integration testing

##Productivity
- Clarity via conciceness
    - Syntax
    - Abstraction
- Synthesis
    - Auto-generated code
- Reuse
- Automation and tools

##Software Development Processes
Can software development be as dependable as building a bridge?
###Plan and Document
- Project manager makes a plan
- Progress measured against the plan

####Waterfall lifecycle (1970)
1. Requirements analysis
2. Architecture
3. Implementation and integration
4. Verification
5. Operation & maintainance

Problem: It's just what we asked for, but not what we want.
"Throw away the first iteration...you will anyhow."

####Spiral
Similar to waterfall, but with short iterations on the process
Benefits:
- Iterations involve customers
- Riskmanagement
- Easier to monitor project
- Schedule projections get more realistic over time
Downsides:
- Iterations 6 to 24 months long
- Lots of documentation
- Cost of process is high
- Hard to meet budget and schedule targets

####Rational Unified Process (RUP)
Phases:
- Inception: Business case set schedule and budget
- Elaboration: use cases SW architecture, prototype
- Construction
- Transition

Benefits:
- Business processes tied to development
- Lots of tools
- Tools support gradual improvement

Downsides:
- Expensive tools
- Only good for medium to large projects
- Requires good judgement by project management

####Project management
- Plan and develop strategy requires strong project management
- Teams are larger
- Communication time grows with team size
- Groups of 4 to 9, but many such groups on large projects
